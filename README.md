<h1> ALX Low-Level Programming </h1>

<h2> Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming </h2>
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by ALX Africa. I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language.
